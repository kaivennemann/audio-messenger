# NoyZChannel

NoyZChannel is a messenger app that transmits text messages by encoding them into high-pitched audio sounds and playing them out. Any device in audible distance can then receive the broadcast message. A demo can be found [here](https://kaivennemann.github.io/audio-messenger/). This project was submitted to Cam Hack 2025, the annual Cambridge hackathon.
